# Amazon-clone
The Amazon Clone project is a demonstration of my web development skills, showcasing the ability to recreate the user interface of the popular e-commerce platform, Amazon. This project is not intended for commercial use but serves as a hands-on example of my proficiency in front-end development technologies.
